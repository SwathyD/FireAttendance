Offline Attendance Collection using Bluetooth Mesh Networks and Proximity Detection

Attendance management is a time consuming yet a necessary process for educational institutes. So we propose aHow  solution wherein, every student and teacher will have an application on their smartphones. When attendance is to be taken, the teacher will trigger the attendance system and all students will mark their attendance from their phones. The attendance will then get transferred to the teachers application via the mesh formed by smartphones. Thus, without any dedicated external infrastructure or time investment, the attendance can be taken reliably and quickly.

How to use?
1) The application needs to be installed on both the teacher and students smartphones
2) Bluetooth and location services should be running on both the ends
3) Teacher can start the attention collection process by entering the current course details, and then pressing 'Start'
4) Students will be able to view the lecture details on their phones, they just need to tap on submit attendance
5) The list of all probable students in visible on the teachers screen
6) Once the teache ends attendance, a csv file will automatically be saved on the device
